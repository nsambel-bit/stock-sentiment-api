## 🎓 API Endpoints Created

### Endpoint 1: `/analyze`
**Purpose:** Analyze sentiment of a single financial text

**Input:**
```json
{
  "text": "Apple stock is performing well"
}
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "text": "Apple stock is performing well",
  "sentiment_scores": {
    "positive": 0.87,
    "negative": 0.05,
    "neutral": 0.08
  },
  "dominant_sentiment": "positive",
  "confidence": 0.87
}
```

### Endpoint 2: `/analyze-stock`
**Purpose:** Analyze multiple news articles about a stock

**Input:**
```json
{
  "symbol": "AAPL",
  "news_articles": [
    "Apple announces record profits",
    "Supply chain concerns for Apple"
  ]
}
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "symbol": "AAPL",
  "articles_analyzed": 2,
  "individual_sentiments": [...],
  "aggregate_sentiment": {
    "positive": 0.65,
    "negative": 0.25,
    "neutral": 0.10
  },
  "overall_sentiment": "positive",
  "confidence": 0.65
}
```

## 💡 Usage Examples for Your GPT

Once deployed, users can interact with your GPT like this:

**User:** "Analyze this: Tesla stock surged 15% on strong delivery numbers"

**GPT:** *Calls your API, interprets results*
"This text shows strong positive sentiment (confidence: 89%). The language indicates bullish market movement with phrases like 'surged' and 'strong delivery numbers'..."

**User:** "What's the overall sentiment for Apple based on these 5 articles?" *[pastes articles]*

**GPT:** *Calls /analyze-stock endpoint*
"Based on analysis of 5 articles, Apple shows moderately positive sentiment (confidence: 67%). 3 articles were positive, 1 neutral, 1 negative..."
